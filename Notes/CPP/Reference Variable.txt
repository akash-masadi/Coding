Reference Variable & :-
It creates a contant pointer to a constant integer.

Indirection ( * ) Operator => The unary * operator—commonly referred to as the indirection
operator or dereferencing operator—returns an lvalue representing
the object to which its pointer operand points. 

Reference variable / Address ( & ) Operator =>
The address operator ( & ) is a unary operator that obtains the
memory address of its operand.

In C++, & i introced by focusing which is already present in C.
In C :
 1]
int const ptr;
	|         >---- they both imply the same " a ptr variable which is a (constant integer type / integer constant type {both imply the same})"
 const int ptr;

2]
int const *ptr;
	|         >---- they both imply the same " a ptr is a pointer variable which points a (constant integer type / integer constant type)"
 const int *ptr;

3]
const int * const ptr;

This exactly what the Reference variable implementation is.

This is a constant pointer variable pointing towards a integer constant / constant integer.
